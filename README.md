# Enhancing-Employee-Performance-and-Retention-through-HR-Analytics-with-Power-BI
## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to aid organizations in enhancing employee performance and mitigating attrition by constructing an HR analytics dashboard. The dashboard facilitates informed decision-making by offering valuable insights into employee data, thereby fostering improvements in employee satisfaction and retention.

## Data Cleaning and Processing:
Several meticulous steps were executed to prepare the data for analysis. This included the removal of null values, elimination of duplicates, correction of spelling errors, and the assignment of appropriate data types. A conditional column for attrition count was introduced, categorizing 'yes' as 1 and 'no' as 0. Additionally, a new measure was devised to compute the attrition rate, derived by dividing the total attrition count by the overall employee count.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
To initiate the analysis, crucial key performance indicators (KPIs) were identified for tracking and monitoring employee performance and attrition. These KPIs were visualized using card visualizations in Power BI, including overall employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, active employee count, and average age.

## Insights Gained:
The analysis incorporated various charts and visualizations to extract insights from the employee data. Notable observations included attrition concentration in the R&D Department, the highest employee count in the 25-34 age group, and job role distribution by job satisfaction scores. Further insights were drawn from attrition counts based on education fields and attrition rates by gender within different age groups.

## Filters:
To enhance user interaction, department filters were integrated at the dashboard's top, enabling users to selectively filter the entire dashboard based on specific departments.

## Suggestions:
Recommendations for the HR department to improve employee performance and retention include addressing the higher attrition rate among male employees, identifying root causes in the R&D and Sales Departments, and focusing on the concerns of employees in the 25-34 age group. Suggestions also involve reviewing job roles with high attrition rates and providing training and development opportunities.

## Conclusion:
This HR analytics dashboard serves as a pivotal tool for making informed decisions and fostering a positive work environment. By proactively addressing employee concerns and creating supportive conditions, the HR department can contribute to improved employee performance, longer tenures, and ultimately, the overall success of the organization.
